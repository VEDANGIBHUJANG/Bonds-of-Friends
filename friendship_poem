In the garden of life, where moments bloom,
A friendship's seed was gently sown,
With laughter's sunlight and kindness' rain,
A beautiful bond began to be known.

Through fields of joy and valleys of tears,
Side by side, we walked the way,
A steadfast presence, a listening ear,
In the symphony of life, you'll forever stay.
